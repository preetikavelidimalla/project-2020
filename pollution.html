        About Water Pollution:
   </h2>
   <section class="About">
    We already know that Water is the most important resource on the planet. 
    It is the essence of all life on earth. And yet if you ever see a river or lake around your city, it would be evident to you that we are facing a very serious problem of Water pollution.
    Let us educate ourselves about water and water pollution.
    Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies (like oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, aquifers, and groundwater) usually caused due to human activities.
    Water pollution is defined as the presence in groundwater of toxic chemicals and biological
    agents that exceed what is naturally found in the water and may pose a threat to human health and/or the environment.
    Additionally, water pollution may consist of chemicals introduced into the water bodies as a result of various human activities.
    Drinking water, also called Potable Water, is the water that is considered safe enough for human and animal consumption.
    This is water that is generally used for drinking, cooking, washing, crop irrigation, etc. These days chemicals, bacteria, and other pollutants are even affecting our drinking water.
    Major sources of water pollution are discharge of domestic and agriculture wastes, 
    population growth, excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers and urbanization. Bacterial, 
    viral and parasitic diseases are spreading through polluted water and affecting human health.

                    <h3>Major Effects</h3>
                    <p class="Major">
                    1. Diseases: In humans, drinking or consuming polluted water in any way has many disastrous effects on our health.
                        It causes typhoid, cholera, hepatitis and various other diseases.<br>
                    2. Eutrophication: Chemicals in a water body, encourage the growth of algae. These algae form a layer on top of the pond or lake.
                     Bacteria feed on this algae and this decreases the amount of oxygen in the water body, severely affecting the aquatic life there.<br>
                    3. Effects the food chain: Disruption in food chains happens when toxins and pollutants in the water are consumed by aquatic animals (fish, shellfish etc) which are then consumed by humans.<br>
                    4. Destruction of Ecosystems: Ecosystems are extremely dynamic and respond to even small changes in the environment.
                     Water pollution can cause an entire ecosystem to collapse if left unchecked.

                    <h2>Prevention Measures:</h2>
                    <p class="Major2">
                        The best way to prevent large-scale water pollution is to try and reduce its harmful effects.
                        There are various small changes we can make to protect ourselves from a scary future where water is scarce.<br>
                        1. Abstain from flushing contaminated liquids, pills, drugs, or medications down the drain.
                         These substances contain scores of toxic materials that destroy the quality of natural water systems. Instead, use the recommended disposal methods.<br>
                        2. Reduce the use of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers. Excessive use of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers leads to water pollution as the chemicals contained in the products often find way into the water systems through surface runoff or infiltration into the soil.
                          Minimizing their usage or using organic methods for pest, weed, and disease control can appreciably reduce water pollution.<br>
                        3. Always conserve water. Play an active role in reducing water pollution by conserving water at all time. You can achieve this by ensuring the taps are always turned off when they are not in use. Conserving water reduces the amount of contaminated water that needs to be treated.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p class="Major1">
                        4. Skip the use of plastics. Plastic leftovers such as used plastic water bottles, disposable plastic plates, and plastic bags frequently end up in the oceans, lakes, streams and rivers, contaminating natural habitats and destroying aquatic life.<br>
                        5. Keep your boat well maintained if you have one or in charge of any. Ensure your boat is in good condition at all times to avoid toxic substances from leaking into the water.<br>
                        6. Use environmentally friendly products: By using soluble products that do not go on to become pollutants, we can reduce the amount of water pollution caused by a household.<br>
