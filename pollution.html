      <img class="float_left_small" src="images/tar (1).jpg" alt="water pollution image">
      <p>We already know that Water is the most important resource on the planet.
        It is the essence of all life on earth. And yet if you ever see a river or lake around your city, it would be evident to you that we are facing a very serious problem of Water pollution.</p>

      <p>Let us educate ourselves about water and water pollution.
        Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies (like oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, aquifers, and groundwater) usually caused due to human activities.</p>

      <p>Water pollution is defined as the presence in groundwater of toxic chemicals and biological
        agents that exceed what is naturally found in the water and may pose a threat to human health and/or the environment.
        Additionally, water pollution may consist of chemicals introduced into the water bodies as a result of various human activities.
        Drinking water, also called Potable Water, is the water that is considered safe enough for human and animal consumption.
        This is water that is generally used for drinking, cooking, washing, crop irrigation, etc. These days chemicals, bacteria, and other pollutants are even affecting our drinking water.</p>
      <p> Major sources of water pollution are discharge of domestic and agriculture wastes,
        population growth, excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers and urbanization. Bacterial,
        viral and parasitic diseases are spreading through polluted water and affecting human health.</p>

            <p class="center">
              Waste water from manufacturing or chemical processes in industries contributes to water pollution. Industrial waste water usually contains specific and readily identifiable chemical compounds. Water pollution is
              concentrated
              within a few subsectors, mainly in the form of toxic wastes and organic pollutants.

            <img class="float_right_small" src="images/sewage.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="center">Domestic households, industrial and agricultural practices produce wastewater that can cause pollution of many lakes and rivers. Sewage is the term used for wastewater that often contains faeces, urine and laundry waste.
              There are billions of people on Earth, so treating sewage is a big priority.</p>

            <p class="center">Environmental impacts of mining can occur at local, regional, and global scales through direct and indirect mining practices. Impacts can result in erosion, sinkholes, loss of biodiversity, or the contamination of soil,
              groundwater, and surface water by the chemicals emitted from mining processes. These processes also have an impact on the atmosphere from the emissions of carbon which have effect on the quality of human health and
              biodiversity. </p>

            <p>Marine Dumping has been defined as the deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures, as well as the deliberate disposal of these vessels or platforms
              themselves. Marine dumping can destroy or degrade important habitats for aquatic species and cause coastal erosion and salutation, which affect the health and productivity of the marine environment.</p>

        1. Diseases: In humans, drinking or consuming polluted water in any way has many disastrous effects on our health.
        It causes typhoid, cholera, hepatitis and various other diseases.<br>
        2. Eutrophication: Chemicals in a water body, encourage the growth of algae. These algae form a layer on top of the pond or lake.
        Bacteria feed on this algae and this decreases the amount of oxygen in the water body, severely affecting the aquatic life there.<br>
        3. Effects the food chain: Disruption in food chains happens when toxins and pollutants in the water are consumed by aquatic animals (fish, shellfish etc) which are then consumed by humans.<br>
        4. Destruction of Ecosystems: Ecosystems are extremely dynamic and respond to even small changes in the environment.
        Water pollution can cause an entire ecosystem to collapse if left unchecked.

              <p> 1. The best way to prevent large-scale water pollution is to try and reduce its harmful effects.
                There are various small changes we can make to protect ourselves from a scary future where water is scarce.<br>
                Avoid using the toilet as a wastebasket. Most tissues, wrappers, dust cloths, and other paper goods should be properly discarded in a wastebasket. The fiber reinforced cleaning products that have become popular should never be
                discarded in the toilet.</p>

              <img class="float_right_small" src="images/organic.jpg" alt="">
              <p> 2. Reduce the use of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers. Excessive use of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers leads to water pollution as the chemicals contained in the products often find way into the water
                systems
                through surface runoff or infiltration into the soil. Try organic farming techniques, Organic farming is a method of crop and livestock production that involves much more than choosing not to use pesticides, fertilizers, genetically
                modified organisms, antibiotics and growth hormones.</p>

              <img class="float_left_small" src="images/tap.jpg" alt="">
              <p>3. Always conserve water. Play an active role in reducing water pollution by conserving water at all time. You can achieve this by ensuring the taps are always turned off when they are not in use. Conserving water
                reduces
                the
                amount of contaminated water that needs to be treated. Water conservation is the practice of using water efficiently to reduce unnecessary water usage. According to Fresh Water Watch, water conservation is important because fresh
                clean water is a limited resource, as well as a costly one.</p>

              <img class="float_left_small" src="images/help_fish.jpg" alt="">
              <p> 4. Skip the use of plastics. Plastic leftovers such as used plastic water bottles, disposable plastic plates, and plastic bags frequently end up in the oceans, lakes, streams and rivers, contaminating natural habitats
                and
                destroying aquatic life.</p>

              <p> 5. Use the minimum amount of detergent and/or bleach when you are washing clothes or dishes. Use only phosphate free soaps and detergents. Water pollution by chemicals (such as detergents) is a big concern in the global context.
                Many laundry detergents contain approximately 35 percent to 75 percent phosphate salts. Phosphates can cause a variety of water pollution problems. For example, phosphate tends to inhibit the biodegradation of organic substances.</p>

              <img class="float_left_small" src="images/industry.jpg" alt="">
              <p>6. Some industrial facilities generate wastewater that is similar to domestic sewage and can be treated by sewage treatment plants. Industries that generate wastewater with high concentrations of organic matter (e.g. oil and grease),
                toxic pollutants (e.g. heavy metals, volatile organic compounds) or nutrients such as ammonia, need specialized treatment systems. Some industries install a pre-treatment system to remove some pollutants (e.g., toxic compounds), and
                then discharge the partially treated wastewater to the municipal sewer system.</p>
