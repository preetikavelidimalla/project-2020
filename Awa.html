            <p>As we all know water is becoming scarce every passing day. It is our priority to bring awareness in public to use water judiciously.
                Water pollution and Conservation awareness is an incredibly important part of our lives. In order to protect the sustainability of the planet, everyone needs to commit to becoming more aware about water pollution and conservation.
                There is no doubt that human activity is hugely responsible for polluting the water.
                So it is important for everyone to improve their awareness about water pollution and water conservation. Water is essential to allow the cycle of life. Ecosystems are at risk and billions of human lives depend on access to safe water.
                 Having access to pure, clean and fresh drinking water is essential for every human being.
                 Therefore, it is important that we take steps for both water conservation and water preservation.
                 </p>
                
            <p>While our bodies can definitely survive for weeks on end without any food, you only stay alive for a few days without the hydrating properties of water.
                Unsafe water is responsible for 1.2 million deaths each year.
               6% of deaths in low-income countries are the result of unsafe water sources.
               666 million (9% of the world) does not have access to an improved water source.
               2.1 billion (29% of the world) do not have access to safe drinking water.So to stop all this we should take specefic majors to prevent water pollution and to save water for our future generation.</p>
            <p>Water problems will not go away by themselves. On the contrary, they will worsen unless we,
                as a global community, respond and use water responsibly. So, before it is too late, let us all, as
                individuals, families, communities, companies & institutions, pledge towards using water
                wisely. Intelligence is not in lavishness but in conservation, so that our future generations can
                continue to enjoy the blissful feeling and touch of water.</p>

                        <h3>Starting Water Pollution and Water Conservation Awareness from Your Home.</h3>

                        <p>a. Shower vs. Bath:
                            A full bathtub can use around 70 gallons of water. A shower uses an average of 25 gallons. That’s a savings of 45 gallons in just one shower.
                            Reduce the amount of time you spend in the shower and replace the shower head with a low-flow head for an even greater decrease in water use.
                        </p>
                        <p>b. Leaky Pipes:One the most common and least productive wastes of water is a leaky pipe. U.S. News reports that the average household can leak more than 10,000 gallons of water per year. The biggest culprit is the toilet, where leaks are more common because of frequent use. 
                            You’ll usually hear it if your toilet isn’t working properly. If it runs when it’s not in use, check the valves and inner parts.A worn-out pipe or broken o-ring could be adding gallons to your water bill. Have your pipes examined annually to prevent more serious problems. </p>

                        <p>Rainwater harvesting is the process of collecting and storage of rainwater for various purposes is called rainwater harvesting.
                             Rainwater is collected from a roof, surface, deep pit, or reservoir. It uses include watering garden, irrigation, domestic uses with proper treatment and domestic heating.
                             Rainwater harvesting scheme its numerous individual, as well as community benefits, can be an effective tool in developing a sustainable urban environment.
                             There are 7 types of rainwater harvesting: Water butt,Direct pumped,Indirect pumped,Indirect gravity,Gravity only,Relation ponds and In ground storage.</p>

                        <p>Aquifer recovery and storage is another water scarcity solution. Here, recharge is done via surface infiltration into unconfined, shallow aquifers.
                            In recent years, this process has evolved to accommodate direct injection into deeper aquifer systems, including those containing poor quality groundwater, 
                            making freshwater storage available in areas where none formerly existed. A major constraint to recharging by injection and infiltration is the clogging of pores from particulates, chemical precipitation, and biofilm formation. This can have adverse effects on the quality of groundwater such as the formation of dissolved sulfides and iron solubilization (EPA, 2017).
                            That notwithstanding, if done and controlled properly, these two methods can greatly reduce the level of water scarcity in some areas stricken by this phenomenon.

                        <p>Water infrastructure is a very important element of water management and control. It includes all the infrastructure used to build, pump, transport, divert, store, treat, and deliver safe drinking water, as well the tools and equipment used to build them.
                             These structures include groundwater wells, dams, storage tanks, surface-water intakes, pipes, drinking-water facilities, and aqueducts.
                              With poor water infrastructure inevitably comes water scarcity. This is why it is important for us to improve the quality of our water infrastructure be it natural or artificial.</p>
                            <p>Infrastructure also encompasses natural infrastructure which makes use of landscape management techniques such as conservation, restoration, and sustainable management.
                             These techniques provide basic water services such as flood control, aquifer storage and recharge, and providing a clean and abundant supply of water. 
                             Improved infrastructure will not only reduce the amount of clean water being wasted but will also help reduce the number of persons constantly searching for clean water on a daily basis (EPA, 2018).</p>

                        <p>Donating to a charity will help in a small way; charities help people in rural areas get access to waters by constructing wells, sanitation, and agricultural systems.
                            Governments could allocate more funding toward ending the water crisis; currently,
                             the US government donates $8 billion every year, $1 Trillion is needed to solve the problem in the long term.

                        <p>Another very important and simple solution to the problem of water scarcity is to increase awareness and education on water scarcity and its effects.
                             There are a lot of people who are unaware of the reality of water scarcity as well as its negative effects and the number of people suffering from it. We must educate people on how to conserve water,
                              on how to support water organizations and NGOs, and on the importance of water. Raising awareness and educating people on the reality of water scarcity,
                             its effects and the importance of conserving water is an important step in the fight against water scarcity.</p>

                    <div class="major_causes">
                        <p>As has been previously mentioned, over a billion people lack access to clean and safe water. And while some of us,
                             especially those in developed countries, are predisposed to clean and safe water, there are a lot of people who spend a whole day searching for water to drink.
                              It is up to us to implement any of the aforementioned viable solutions in order to redress the issue of water scarcity and make the world a better place for many. After all, water is life and by contributing in our own little way to this fight, we are literally adding drops of water into the ocean!

                            <h3>Issue:</h3><p>Sub-Saharan Africa is the home to hundreds of millions of people who suffer from water scarcity issues. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that more than 40 percent of the global water-stressed population lives in Sub-Saharan Africa.
                                 In this region, only an estimated 44 percent of the urban population and 24 percent of the rural population have adequate sanitation.
                                 Women and children in Africa walk for miles to obtain water from streams and ponds that often contain disease-causing organisms,
                                  such as those that cause cholera, typhoid fever, and infant diarrhea.Lack of access to clean water is one of the biggest causes of poverty in Africa.Economic growth in Africa has been fueled by the exploitation of natural resources, and this had led to water pollution and an increased demand for water resources .Climatic and environmental changes have decreased these water resources even more. 
                                  Climatic changes and deforestation in Sub-Saharan Africa have led to increased desertification.  </p><br>

                                  <h3>Current efforts underway to address water scarcity issues in Africa:</h3><br>
                                  <p>Water investment is critical to help bring Africa’s people out of poverty. 
                                      The World Health Organization reports that every $1 investment made into clean water efforts leads to $3-4 dollars generated in regional economies .
                                      Non-profit organizations such as The Water Project are helping communities to obtain clean water through training, financial support, and advisement on the construction of water projects. 
                                      They assist communities like creating wells,rain collection, maintaining sanitary practice,water filtration and sub-surface dam construction.
                                      Permaculture and other sustainable farming techniques are now being applied in various places in Africa that will help to greatly reduce the water demand for water use and other inputs in agriculture .

                            <h2>2. California: It’s Complicated Drought, Drinking Water, and Drylands</h2><br>
                            <img class="float_left_small"src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.nautil.us%2F6676_28bda53c86d37e275a3ebfdc113b1f59.jpg&f=1&nofb=1" alt="Overflowing California reservoirs not enough to quench">
                            <p> For 5 years (2012–16), California experienced the most severe drought conditions in its recorded history.
                                The US Drought Monitor identified the California drought as “exceptional,” the most intense category. Data from the National Climatic Data Center show the 2012–14 3-year period was “by far the hottest and driest” in the full instrumental record from 1895.
                                The California Department of Water Resources confirmed 2012–15 were the four driest consecutive water years in the historical record (September 2016). The winter of 2016–17 brought improved rainfall, and by its end, the Great California Drought was over.
                                Reservoirs have recovered, but a number of aquifers remain in serious overdraft (Medellín-Azuara, August 15, 2016). The Drought had a severe impact on two ecosystems—surface water and ground water. Those ecosystems provide two services—drinking water and agricultural irrigation .
                                The locale is California’s San Joaquin Valley, the heart of agriculture in the state and the site where the two ecosystems services (drinking water and agricultural irrigation) came into sharp conflict during the Drought. Smaller communities, especially economically disadvantaged communities, and their residents have shallower and cheaper wells that draw upon the upper layers of an aquifer.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    A number of these wells ran dry or became contaminated by an increasing concentration of pollutants from agricultural fertilizers and pesticides. Neither the residents nor their small and economically disadvantaged communities have the financial resources to remedy the drinking water crisis. </p><br>
                            <h3>Managing California’s Water System in the Future:</h3><br>
                            <img class="float_right_small"src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgdb.voanews.com%2F8AFAAE77-52DC-4B50-98BA-E58837B41E29_mw1024_s_n.png&f=1&nofb=1" alt=" California in future ">
                            <p> Looking into the future, Much of the work involves managing water supply for reliability, which includes managing for drought and providing assistance and tools to local water agencies to help them reduce their drought vulnerability. Drought preparedness activities are very important to prepare for California’s inevitable swing between flood and drought conditions.
                            The extent to which carry out the drought preparedness activities is dependent on funding, which is primarily available during droughts.
                        There are resources like California's Most Significant Drought, California Data Exchange Center, Western Regional Climate Center and NASA etc.. </p>
